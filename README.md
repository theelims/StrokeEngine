# StrokeEngine
A library to create a variety of stroking motions with a stepper or servo motor on an ESP32. A usage example can be found in my other related project: [FuckIO](https://github.com/theelims/FuckIO). It will work with all kinds of stepper / servo operated fucking and stroking machines. An other popular example is the Kinky Makers [OSSM-Project](https://github.com/KinkyMakers/OSSM-hardware)

Every DIY fucking machine with a linear position drive powered by a stepper or servo motor can be used with this library. 

## Concepts
StrokeEngine takes full advantage of the freedom a servo / stepper driven stroking or fucking machine can provide over fixed cam-driven designs. To this date there are only few commercial offerings using this advantage. And often so the implementation is rather boring, not utilizing the full possibilities of such a linear position drive.

## Supported Hardware
By default two Motor types are supported
- LinMot Linear Motors (CANOpen)
- Stepper Motors (Step/Dir Pulses)

Motors in StrokeEngine are abstracted away, to allow the end-user to provide a compatible motor implementation.
So if your motor uses a new communication protocol, like EtherCAT or Ethernet/IP, the work needed to integrate StrokeEngine is kept minimal.

Homing can be handled in two different ways.
- Sensor-less - Home will be determined by moving in a specific direction until a desired current, and thus torqe/force threshold has been reached. This threshold indicates the machine has reached it's start of motion point.
- Sensored - Home will be determined by moving in a specific direction until a physical switch has been activated

### LinMot Linear Motors (CANOpen)
The current LinMot implementation is tied to [CANFuck](https://github.com/zylos146/CANFuck), which acts similar to OSSM providing a unified controller for the hardware.

### Stepper Motors (Step/Dir Pulses)
Under the hood it uses the fabulous [FastAccelStepper](https://github.com/gin66/FastAccelStepper) library to interface stepper or servo motors with commonly found STEP / DIR interfaces.

### Coordinate System
The machine uses an internal metric (mm, m/s, m/s<sup>2</sup>) coordinate system for all motion planning. This offers an advantage, that this is independent of a specific implementation and works with all machine sizes and regardless of the motor chosen.

Each motor is expected to handle converting from metric Motion Commands into their own relative coordinate system. There is a standard way mapping these two coordinate systems is handled.

![Coordinate System](./doc/coordinates.svg)
* The system is 1-dimensional and the positive move direction is towards the front a.k.a. towards the body.
* The __physicalTravel__ is the real physical travel the machine has from one hard endstop to the other. 
* From `physicalTravel` a safety distance called __keepoutBoundary__ is subtracted on each side giving the real working distance **_travel**: 
  ```
  _travel = physicalTravel - (2 * keepoutBoundary)
  ``` 
  This gives a safety margin to avoid crashes into a hard endstop.
* The __Home__-position is expected to be at `-keepoutBoundary`. Albeit not recommended for safety reasons, it is possible to mount the home switch in the front at `physicalTravel` as well.
* Zero __MIN = 0__ is `keepoutBoundary` away from the home position.
* Pattern make use of __Depth__ and __Stroke__. These values are dynamic parameter and may be adjusted during runtime:
  * __Depth__ is the furthest point the machine can extract at any given time. This is useful to find a sweet spot in positioning the body relative to the machine.
  * __Stroke__ is the longest working distance a stroking motion will have.

Think of __Stroke__ as the amplitude and __Depth__ a linear offset that is added.

### Pattern
One of the biggest benefits of a linear position drive over a cam-driven motion is its versatility. StrokeEngine uses a pattern generator to provide a wide variety of sensations where parameters like speed, stroke and depth are adjusted dynamically on a motion by motion basis. It uses a trapezoidal motion profile with a defined acceleration and deceleration distance. In between it moves with a constant speed. Pattern take __depth__, __stroke__, __speed__ and an arbitrary __sensation__ parameter. In [Pattern.md](./Pattern.md) you can find a detailed description of each available pattern. Also some information how to write your own patterns and contribute them to this project.

### Graceful Behavior
One design goal was to have a unobtrusive failure handling when invalid parameters are given. Either from the user with values that lay outside the physics of the machine, or from a pattern commanding an impossible speed, position or acceleration. 

All `MotorInterface` implementations are expected to constrain any Motion Command which will exit the provided `motionBounds`. The command will still execute, but the full range of motion will be cut short. This manifests in a distortion of the motion. Strokes may be shortened when position targets outside of the machine bounds are requested (e.g. `stroke > depth`). Acceleration and speed are limited leading to distorted ramps. The motion is executed over the full distance, but may take slightly longer then expected to reach the target position. 

### Mid-Stroke Parameter Update
It is possible to update any parameter like depth, stroke, speed and pattern mid-stroke. This gives a very responsive and fluid user experience. Safeguards are in place to ensure the move stays inside the bounds of the machine at any time.

## Usage
StrokeEngine aims to have a simple and straight forward, yet powerful API. The following describes the minimum case to get up and running. All input parameters need to be specified in real world (metric) units.

First all parameters of the machine and the servo need to be set. Including the pins for interacting with the driver and an (optionally) homing switch.

Inside `void setup()` call the following functions to initialize the StrokeEngine:
```cpp
float position = 0;
void app_motion(void *pvParameter) {
  while (true) {
    if (motor->isInState(MotorState::ACTIVE) && motor->hasStatusFlag(MOTOR_FLAG_HOMED) && !engine->isActive()) {
      ESP_LOGE("main", "Motor ready and homed. Attempting to start Stroke Engine");
      engine->startPattern();
    }

    vTaskDelay(1000 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);
  }
}

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Wire.begin(I2C_SDA_PIN, I2C_SCL_PIN);

  ESP_LOGI("main", "Starting Blynk");
  Blynk.begin(BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN, WIFI_SSID, WIFI_PASS);

  ESP_LOGI("main", "Configuring Motor");
  motor = new StepperMotor();

  motionBounds bounds = {
    .start = 160, // mm
    .end = 0, // mm
    .keepout = 5 // mm
  };
  motor->setMaxSpeed(5000); // 5 m/s
  motor->setMaxAcceleration(25000); // 25 m/s^2
  motor->setBounds(bounds);
  // TODO - Set Stepper Parameters here

  ESP_LOGI("main", "Configuring Stroke Engine");
  engine = new StrokeEngine();
  c->attachMotor(motor);
  engine->setParameter(StrokeParameter::PATTERN, 0);
  engine->setParameter(StrokeParameter::RATE, 50);
  engine->setParameter(StrokeParameter::DEPTH, 100);
  engine->setParameter(StrokeParameter::STROKE, 50);
  engine->setParameter(StrokeParameter::SENSATION, 0);

  ESP_LOGI("main", "Registering Tasks (Motor)");
  motor->registerTasks();

  ESP_LOGI("main", "Homing Motor");
  motor->enable();
  motor->goToHome();
  
  ESP_LOGI("main", "Starting Motion Task!");
  xTaskCreate(&app_motion, "app_motion", 4096, NULL, 5, NULL);
  //xTaskCreate(&app_blynk, "app_blynk", 4096, NULL, 5, NULL);
}
```

#### > Retrieve Available Patterns as JSON-String
This is an example snippet showing how `Stroker.getNumberOfPattern()` and `Stroker.getPatternName(i)` may be used to iterate through the available patterns and composing a JSON-String.
```cpp
String getPatternJSON() {
    String JSON = "[{\"";
    for (size_t i = 0; i < engine->getNumberOfPattern(); i++) {
        JSON += String( engine->getPatternName(i));
        JSON += "\": ";
        JSON += String(i, DEC);
        if (i < Stroker.getNumberOfPattern() - 1) {
            JSON += "},{\"";
        } else {
            JSON += "}]";
        }
    }
    Serial.println(JSON);
    return JSON;
}
```

### Running
#### > Start & Stop the Stroking Action
Use `engine->startPattern();` and `engine->stopPattern();` to start and stop the motion. Stop is immediate and with the highest possible acceleration.

#### > Move to the Minimum or Maximum Position
You can move to either end of the machine for setting up reaches. Call `motor->goToPos(0, speed, acceleratio)` to move all they way back towards home. With `motor->goToPos(motor->getBounds().end, speed, acceleration)` it moves all the way out.

#### > Setup Optimal Depth/Stroke Interactively
There is a special pattern `Adjust Depth` which allows setting up an optimal depth/stroke. 

This pattern allows not only to interactively adjust `depth`, but also `stroke` by using the sensation slider. `sensation` gets mapped into the interval `[depth-stroke, depth]`: `sensation = 100` adjusts `depth`-position, whereas `sensation = -100` adjusts the `stroke`-position. `sensation = 0` yields the midpoint of the stroke.

#### > Set Parameters
```cpp
enum class StrokeParameter {
  // RATE & SPEED are mutually exclusive. Only one can be specified at a time!
  // RATE - Range 0.5 to 600 Strokes / Min
  // Can allow better control typically than just SPEED, as other machines use
  RATE,

  // SPEED - Range 1 to 5000 mm / Sec
  // Standard Speed Control
  SPEED,

  // DEPTH - Range is constrainted by motionBounds from MotorInterface
  // Is the point at which the stroke ends
  DEPTH, 

  // STROKE - Range is constrainted by motionBounds from MotorInterface
  // How far the stroke will retract from DEPTH point
  STROKE, 

  // SENSATION - Range is -100 to 100
  // Serves as a generic parameter for usage by patterns to adjust sensation
  SENSATION,

  PATTERN
};

void setParameter(StrokeParameter parameter, float value, bool applyNow = false);
float getParameter(StrokeParameter parameter);

```
Parameters can be updated in any state and are stored internally. On `engine->startPattern();` they will be used to initialize the pattern. Each one may be get/set individually. The argument given to the function is constrained to the physical limits of the machine (depth/stroke within `[0, maxTravel]`)
```cpp
engine->setParameter(StrokeParameter::PATTERN, 0); // Pattern, index must be < Stroker.getNumberOfPattern()
engine->setParameter(StrokeParameter::RATE, 50); // Speed in Cycles (in & out) per minute
engine->setParameter(StrokeParameter::DEPTH, 100); // Depth in mm
engine->setParameter(StrokeParameter::STROKE, 50); // Stroke length in mm
engine->setParameter(StrokeParameter::SENSATION, 0); // Sensation (arbitrary value a pattern may use to alter its behavior), constrained to [-100, 100] with 0 being neutral.
```
Normally a parameter change is only executed after the current stroke has finished. However, sometimes it is desired to have the changes take effect immediately, even mid-stroke. In that case set the argument `bool applyNow` to `true`. 

#### > Get Parameters


```cpp
float value = engine->getParameter(StrokeParameter::PATTERN); // Pattern, index must be < Stroker.getNumberOfPattern()
float value = engine->setParameter(StrokeParameter::RATE); // Speed in Cycles (in & out) per minute
float value = engine->setParameter(StrokeParameter::DEPTH); // Depth in mm
float value = engine->setParameter(StrokeParameter::STROKE); // Stroke length in mm
float value = engine->setParameter(StrokeParameter::SENSATION); // Sensation (arbitrary value a pattern may use to alter its behavior), constrained to [-100, 100] with 0 being neutral.
```
